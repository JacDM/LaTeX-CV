I am excited to apply for the Computer Science Intern position at your organization.
As a highly motivated computer science student, I believe that this internship 
opportunity aligns perfectly with my academic and professional goals.

%I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science and have gained a strong 
%foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C\#. I have also 
%completed coursework in data structures and algorithms, software engineering,
%and data Communications and networking, which has given me a solid understanding
%of the core concepts in computer science.

In addition to my academic experience, I have also completed several personal projects 
which have allowed me to further develop my programming skills. For example, i worked
as a Scrum Master/full stack developer for a year long software engineering project called GeoTagAR
where i was in charge of developing the AR component of the application and implementing 
scrum framework.

I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a real-world setting and believe that 
this internship will provide me with the opportunity to do so. 
I am ready to work alongside experienced professionals and learn from them while 
contributing to the success of the organization.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for an interview at your 
convenience and look forward to hearing from you.
